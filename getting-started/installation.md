Installation
============

Nice makes use of [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies.

## Installing Nice

The recommended way to install Nice is to run the
`composer require` command in your project directory:

```bash
composer require nice/framework:~1.0
```

This command will download and install Nice into the current directory, and update the `composer.json` with
the new dependency.


## What's next?

Get started with [your first Nice app](your-first-app.md).
